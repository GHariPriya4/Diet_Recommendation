Project Description:

Our project addresses the critical need for personalized diet recommendations catering to diverse demographics and health conditions. We've developed a comprehensive diet recommendation system utilizing machine learning algorithms to provide tailored meal plans for three distinct user groups.

Problem Statement:
The problem we aim to solve is the lack of personalized diet guidance, which often results in individuals following generic or inappropriate meal plans, leading to health complications or inefficiencies in achieving nutritional goals.

Solution Overview:
Our system comprises three models tailored to different user requirements:

Balanced Diet Recommendation Model: This model focuses on recommending dishes based on user-specific factors such as height, weight, age, gender, dietary preferences (vegetarian, non-vegetarian), and ingredient choices. By inputting these parameters, the system calculates the user's daily calorie intake and recommends meals ensuring optimal nutrition levels including sugar, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, and protein.

Custom Diet Recommendation Model: Here, users have the flexibility to specify the desired nutritional content for their daily intake. They can input the precise amounts of nutrients they wish to consume, along with preferences for specific ingredients. This model empowers users to tailor their meal plans according to their unique dietary goals and preferences.

Health Condition-Specific Diet Recommendation Model: Targeting individuals with common health conditions such as blood pressure, fever, cold, diabetes, digestive problems, and PCODs, this model provides specialized dietary recommendations. By aggregating information from reputable health websites and diet recommending platforms, the system identifies ingredients recommended by healthcare professionals for specific health conditions. Additionally, it ensures that the recommended meal plans adhere to the prescribed nutritional content levels suitable for managing these health conditions effectively.

Project's Purpose and Basic Functionality:
The purpose of our project is to offer personalized diet recommendations that address individual needs, preferences, and health conditions. Each model within our system serves a distinct user group, ensuring that users receive tailored meal plans aligned with their specific requirements. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we provide a user-friendly interface where users can input their details or health conditions, and receive detailed meal plans that optimize their nutrition intake while promoting overall well-being.
